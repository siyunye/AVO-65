AVO-65: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Audio-Visual Object DatasetOfficial repository for the paper: "AVO-65: A LARGE-SCALE HIERARCHICAL AUDIO-VISUAL OBJECT DATASET" (Submitted to ICASSP 2026).🚀 OverviewAVO-65 is a novel, object-centric audio-visual dataset designed to advance research in robust multimodal learning. Unlike previous datasets that focus on flat labels or single modalities, AVO-65 treats auditory and visual modalities with equal importance and provides a rigorous hierarchical structure.Key Features:Scale: ~30,000 high-quality video segments (~83 hours).Taxonomy: The first dataset to systematically apply the Hornbostel-Sachs (H-S) taxonomy for hierarchical audio-visual labeling.Consistency: Guaranteed semantic, temporal, and spatial consistencies between audio and visual tracks.Real-world Complexity: 100% real-world samples, retaining challenging cases like occlusion, noise, and modality absence.Granularity: 4-level hierarchical labels covering 65 distinct object categories.📂 Dataset StructureThe dataset is organized into 4 hierarchical levels.
